**Dahlia**

Just another choice...

**Support Typescript?**

Yes, it is total type-safety.


key typings:

```js
declare function createStore<T>(state: T): {
    consume<S>(selector: (state: T) => S, renderFn?: ((partialState: S) => React.ReactNode) | undefined): JSX.Element;
    mutate: (fn: (draft: T) => void) => void;
    getState: () => T;
};
```

**Single store or Multiple store?**

Personally, I would recommend a multi-part solution. More flexible and less Potential performance issues.

**Can I use HOCs?**

No, You don't need it at all. Maybe you are used to using a HOC(like connect, inject) in Redux or Mobx, to get some state or action method in lifecycles. In Stamen, You can access state by `getState()` and actions in lifecycles directly.
